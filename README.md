# 💖 Will You Be My Valentine?

A simple, cute, and interactive web application designed to ask someone to be your Valentine. This project features a playful "No" button that dodges the cursor, ensuring the answer is always "Yes!"

## ✨ Features

* **Interactive UI**: A clean, centered card with cute GIFs.
* **The Dodge Mechanic**: The "No" button uses JavaScript to calculate random coordinates within the viewport, moving away whenever a user tries to hover over it.
* **Success State**: Clicking "Yes" hides the question and triggers a celebration screen with a happy GIF and a heartfelt message.
* **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes using CSS Flexbox.
